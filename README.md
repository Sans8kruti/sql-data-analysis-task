# Task 3 - SQL for Data Analysis

Hi! I'm Sanskruti Junawane, and this is my submission for Task 3 of the Data Analyst internship.

This task was focused on learning how to use SQL for basic data analysis. I used a sample sales dataset (Superstore-like) and wrote different types of queries to answer questions from the data.

## âœ… What I Did:

- Filtered rows using SELECT and WHERE
- Found top customers using ORDER BY and LIMIT
- Grouped data by region using GROUP BY and COUNT
- Combined tables using JOIN
- Used subqueries to compare with average sales
- Created a VIEW to reuse a query
- Optimized a query with filters and limits

## ðŸ“‚ Files in this repo:

- `task3_sql_queries.sql` â€“ all my SQL queries
- `task3_sql_screenshots.pdf` â€“ my explanation of the outputs (simulated screenshots)
- `README.md` â€“ this file you're reading :)

## ðŸ§  Tools I Used:

- SQL (PostgreSQL or SQLite style)
- I created and tested queries manually
- Wrote explanation from scratch to match my understanding

## ðŸ”š Conclusion:

I learned a lot about how SQL can help analyze real-world datasets. The tasks helped me understand how to query, combine, and summarize data â€” which is super useful for any analyst.

Thanks for reviewing my work! :)
